# CLT_calves
 Learn about the CLT by scraping YouTube comments......
 
 # Summary
This repository contains the code to use Selenium to scrape comments from a YouTube video by Sonne Farms that asks users to guess the weight of a calf born on the video. We'll see if the LLN and CLT hold true in this guessing contest. The YouTube video link below walks though the assumptions and code.
